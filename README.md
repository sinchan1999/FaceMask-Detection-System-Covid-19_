# FaceMask-Detection-System-Covid-19_
This system tells whether the individuals wears a mask or not in areas such as-->Offices/School/Universities.
IN last updated I added the mobie_cam.py piece of code which can capture the camera input from devices like mobiles,CCTV's and so on.
Please ignore the mobilecam_test.py its just for testing purposes!
